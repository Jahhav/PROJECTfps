    <h2 id="pink">Fullstack software developer</h2>

    <p>I love to deign complex systems with high levels of automation including AI and robotics. I'm
    deeply interested in inventing new things that can augment the human experience.
    </p>
    <p>Everything I've done, everything I'll do today, everything I'll ever do, I do to protect
    this world. Someone once told me that with great power comes great responsibility.

    <h2>Instruction set</h2>
    <p>All computers run using very low-level commands which do some very basic functions, such as reading
        data, writing data, jumping to addresses, and calculating basic arithmetic. (The complete list of 
        commands that can be run by a CPU is know as that.)
